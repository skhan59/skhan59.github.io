## Completed Projects
#### Below are a sample of completed projects I've worked on throughout my time in Loyola. Each project covers a topic such as Object-Oriented Programming, Cybersecurity, or Project Management. Feel free to click on thumbnails to see the full project. Ongoing projects, which currently don't have any end date insight can be found on the "On Going Projects" Tab.

### Project Management: Toyota Electric Vehicle Prototype Case Study
During my COMP 377: IT Project Management course, my group and I managed a semester long project management cast study. 
Our group studied the costs, risks, and responsibilities that a company like Toyota would need to consider when it comes to building an electric car prototype. 
We used a variety of project management methodologies such as scrum, risk analysis, agile management, and more.

### Internet Privacy Lab: DNS over HTTPS
This project was done during my COMP 388: Advanced Topics in Cybersecurity class. My goal was to examine the security, or lack thereof of DNS (Domain Name System) when it comes to internet browsing. I used Wireshark, a software that allows for internet data to be captured and analyzed, to examine if I can discover what websites people within the same network as me are visiting. I experimented on the desktop versions of Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox.

### COVID: 19 Questions
An Android App I coded using Android Studio + Java. It's a true or false quiz implementing Object-Oriented Programming. The app asks the user 19 questions about the Covid-19 Pandemic, and tests the users ability to differentiate between the truth and widespread fake news.

### Computer Forensics Analysis & Report
Wrote up an official Forensics Report to summarize the actions taken to discover the malware infecting a virtual machine, and how to prevent it from spreading to other computers within the machine's network. I used software such as EnCase versions 6 and 7, Active Disk Editor, and Registry Explorer to analyze the emails being sent to/from this machine, see if any external devices were attached, what websites the user visited, and what antivirus software was running.

### Battleship: A Java Game Made W/Object-Oriented Programming
This is a one player game I made using Java. The program asks the user what level of difficulty the user wants to choose for the game (e.g easy, medium, or hard.) The size of the board, as well as the number of ships placed on the board increases respective to the difficulty level the user chooses. The number of lives however, decreases with the level of difficulty. This program was made early on in my experience with Java, yet it allowed me to creatively think about how different classes can work off of one another.

### Network Security Architecture
For my final project in COMP 348: Network Security, I developed a proposal for improvements a company could make in their network security after they were recently hacked. I proposed the implementation of perimeter and host firewalls, a variety of sensors (IDS, HIDS, WIPS), a VPN, and IP segmentation to keep the network more secure. I also proposed the company use multifactor authentication and email encryption to keep individual machines secure.
