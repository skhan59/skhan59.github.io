### PWC's Cybersecurity Virtual Case Study
This virtual case study was provided by PWC and Forage. The case study involved providing a hypothetical corporation guidance on various cybersecurity best practices. This study allowed me to apply what I have learned in college to create a presentation and written deliverables that tackled due diligence, risk assessment, establishing IT security baselines, network segmentation, network architecture, and more.

### Project Management: Toyota Electric Vehicle Prototype Case Study
During my COMP 377: IT Project Management course, my team and I managed a semester-long project management cast study. 
Our group studied the costs, risks, and responsibilities that a company like Toyota would need to consider when it comes to building an electric car prototype. 
We used a variety of project management methodologies such as scrum, risk analysis, agile management, and more. Microsoft Project was used to divide tasks,
analyze the simulated budget, and track our progress relative to our deadlines.

### TRACEBACK:Hacking/Penetration Simulation
Successfully hacked into the virtual machine provided by the cybersecurity company, Hack the Box. I used resources such as Kali Linux and Open-Source Intelligence to gain root-level access to the machine.

Tools within Kali Linux:
JohntheRipper - Password Cracking
Dirbuster - Brute Force on webservers
PHPMyAdmin - Access hidden databases within the virtual machine

### Internet Privacy Lab: DNS over HTTPS
This project was done during my COMP 388: Advanced Topics in Cybersecurity class. My goal was to examine the security, or lack thereof of DNS (Domain Name System) when it comes to internet browsing. I used Wireshark, a software that allows for internet data to be captured and analyzed, to examine if I can discover what websites people within the same network as me are visiting. I experimented on the desktop versions of Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox.

### Android Stopwatch
Worked in a team of five students to implement a timer as an Android application with event-driven/asynchronous program execution and user-triggered input events. Graphed a state machine model to plan out how the different classes would work off of one another.

### Computer Forensics Analysis & Report
Wrote up an official Forensics Report to summarize the actions taken to discover the malware infecting a virtual machine, and how to prevent it from spreading to other computers within the machine's network. I used software such as EnCase versions 6 and 7, Active Disk Editor, and Registry Explorer to analyze the emails being sent to/from this machine, see if any external devices were attached, what websites the user visited, and what antivirus software was running.

### Battleship: A Java Game Made W/Object-Oriented Programming
This is a one-player game I made using Java. The program asks the user what level of difficulty the user wants to choose for the game (e.g easy, medium, or hard.) The size of the board, as well as the number of ships placed on the board increases respective to the difficulty level the user chooses. The number of lives, however, decreases with the level of difficulty. This program was made early on in my experience with Java, yet it allowed me to creatively think about how different classes can work off of one another.

### Network Security Architecture
For my final project in COMP 348: Network Security, I developed a proposal for improvements a company could make in their network security after they were recently hacked. I proposed the implementation of perimeter and host firewalls, a variety of sensors (IDS, HIDS, WIPS), a VPN, and IP segmentation to keep the network more secure. I also proposed the company use multifactor authentication and email encryption to keep individual machines secure.
