## Competitions

### DesignMerced 2020

DesignMerced 2020 was an online UX Designathon sponsored by the Major League Hacking association. The prompt for the competition was to come up with an app idea that fosters online connections during the age of COVID-19.

My solution was "Impromptu", A web application that connects to one's favorite streaming services. (eg. Netflix, Hulu, etc.) and then allows them to go on a virtual speed date, then a movie date with someone with similar movie tastes.

I used Adobe XD to develop my prototype.

### Hack the Box: Penetration Testing and Capture the Flags
As of March 2020, I’ve been actively competing to obtain a spot on Hack the Box’s Penetration Testing and Capture the Flag leaderboards. The competition is only accessible for competitors who are successfully able to hack their way through the registration page. By far the most difficult competition I’ve competed in, so far I have successfully been able to complete challenges in Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, Steganography, Computer Forensics, and Open Source Intelligence. I’ve also obtained root-level access to the virtual computer known as Traceback, where I had to use Kali Linux and cybersecurity tools to get my way through.
