# Hello, World!

My name is Saad Khan, and I'm a Digital Product Analyst with Alight Solutions. Throughout my professional and educational career, I've gained experience in project management, technical documentation, UX development, cybersecurity best practices, and programming.

I received my bachelor's degree from Loyola University Chicago, where I was on the Cybersecurity track for their Computer Science program. At Loyola, I was a consistent member of the Dean's List.

I am firm believer that technology is the greatest asset to for creating social change. With my education and work experiences, I hope to become a leader in the tech-world in industries such as:

-Human-Computer Interaction

-User/Cyber Security

-Health Technology

-Fair Use & Copyright

-Empathy in User Experience

to help communities feel safe, welcome, and secure in the digital landscape.

Prior to joining Alight, I was working with Dr. Chan-Tin of Loyola University Chicago's Department of Computer Science. Under his guidance, I conducted research internet anonymity, and the potential fallbacks of 'DNS over HTTPS.' I was also a UX Design Intern at a public health startup named Broadstreet. At Broadstreet, I used Adobe Xd to develop mockups a new website to showcase COVID-19 data in an easy-to-read way.

I’ve also held positions as a Summer Extern at AT&T, a Technology Fellow at Nu School, and a Technology Assistant at Loyola University Chicago's School of Law. More detailed explanations of my work history can be found on my LinkedIn profile linked below.
