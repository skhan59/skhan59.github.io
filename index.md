# Hello, World!

I am a highly motivated student on the Cybersecurity track at Loyola University Chicago's Department of Computer Science . Through my studies and experiences, I've become passionate about using my knowledge and skillset in technology to solve social, legal, and ethical issues in industries such as Cybersecurity, Human-Computer Interaction, Healthcare, and Start-Ups.

Currently, I am privileged to be working as a Research Assist and under Dr. Chan-Tin of Loyola University Chicago's Department of Computer Science. We are researching internet anonymity, and the fallbacks of 'DNS over HTTPS.'  I’ve also held positions as a Summer Extern at AT&T, a Technology Fellow at Nu School, and a Technology Assistant at Loyola University Chicago's School of Law.
