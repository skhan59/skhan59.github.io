# Hello, World!

I am a highly motivated student on the Cybersecurity track at Loyola University Chicago's Department of Computer Science . Through my studies and experiences, I've become passionate about using my knowledge and skillset in technology to solve social, legal, and ethical issues in industries such as Internet Privacy, Human-Computer Interaction, Health-Technology, Antitrust, and Start-Ups.

Currently, I am conducting research with Dr. Chan-Tin of Loyola University Chicago's Department of Computer Science. We are researching internet anonymity, and the potential fallbacks of 'DNS over HTTPS.' On weekends, I dedicate ~10 hours helping the Broadstreet+Covid-19 Data Projects. There, I am an Emergency Data Relief Intern where I analyze log files filled with COVID-19 data to create infographs for the public to use.

I’ve also held positions as a Summer Extern at AT&T, a Technology Fellow at Nu School, and a Technology Assistant at Loyola University Chicago's School of Law. More detailed explanations of my work history can be found on my LinkedIn profile linked below.

### Hobbies and Interests: 

In my free time, I enjoy video editing with Final Cut Pro, learning about Universal Basic Income, photography, and overanalyzing MCU and DCEU movies. For the latter, I hope to start a podcast on the subject by Winter 2021!
